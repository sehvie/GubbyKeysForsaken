# GubbyKeys
An AutoHotKey script for Forsaken (Roblox).

## What does this do?
The script is intended for survivors, to allow for abilities (mainly stun-related ones) to be bound to left click instead of a keyboard button. This is already doable in-game, but comes with a few major drawbacks; You can't ask for help by clicking on other players, and you can't emote without wasting the ability.  
This script comes with extra QoL: You can cycle which ability left click is bound to mid-game, It's automatically disabled for emoting, and any option changes are saved.

## Keybinds
M1 (Left Click) : Use selected ability (duh)  
M3 (Middle Click) : Left Click (to ask for pizza)  
F1 : Enable/Disable  
F2 : Cycle Ability Key  
F3 : Change Keybinds  
  (If you use keybinds other than QERT, you can change them here.)
